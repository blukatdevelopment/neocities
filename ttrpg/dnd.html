    <h2>Unchained Worlds: Fantasy</h2>
    <div id="Body", style="display: flex; flex-flow: column;">
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Core Rules</button>
      <div class="content">
        <h3>Keeper and Player</h3>
        <p>The keeper controls the world and runs all non-player characters(NPCs). Each player controls one player character(PC) called a delver which is part of a party of delvers. The keeper retains the right to modify, add, remove, or ignore any rule in this document.</p>
        <h3>Checks</h3>
        <p>A <strong>check</strong> sonsists of rolling a D20 to meet or beat a target number and accomplish a task. If a check is <strong>opposed</strong>, the opposer rolls a D20 as well and the highest wins. A <strong>save</strong> is just a check made to prevent something from happening, such as being grappled.</p>
        <h3>Luck Dice</h3>
        <p>Every player gets 3 luck dice per session. They do not stack. A player may expend one or more luck dice to use them. A luck die can be added or subtracted from any other die roll. If the keeper rolls on a loot table, for instance, luck dice can be added to shift the result.  </p>
        <h3>Hearts</h3>
        <p>A delver loses hearts as they take damage, and they must make a death save if an attack leaves them below 1 heart. A delver's class decides their maximum hearts.</p>
        <h3>Death Save</h3>
        <p>Roll a D6. If you get a 6 or higher, you defy death.</p>
        <h3>Inventory</h3>
        <p>Use plausibility to determine what you can carry.</p>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>A skill is a domain of practical or theoretical knowledge. If you have proficiency in a skill, you gain a +D6 bonus to checks using it. If you have expertise in the skill, that bonus becomes a +2d6. Skills are flexible. While a skill in swords might help you attack with them, it might also help you in smithing them.</p>
      </div>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Combat</button>
      <div class="content">
        <h3>Initiative</h3>
        <p>If it's obvious that one side goes first, they do. Otherwise, each side of the conflict rolls a D6 and the highest goes first. When it's the party's turn, each delver can take their turn. Order can be shifted by player preference, but defaults to going around the table in a clock-wise manner.</p>
        <h3>Attacks</h3>
        <p>To make an attack, roll a D20 against the target, adding any relevant skill bonus. The target rolls a D20 to resist your attack. If you beat the target's roll, you deal damage. If you fail an attack and the target can counter-attack(ie you are sword-fighting or dueling with bows), they hit you and deal damage. On a tie, both sides hit(if possible). </p>
        <h3>Multi-attacks</h3>
        <p>To make a multi-attack, make a normal attack and roll an extra D20 for the second attack. Roll all bonuses once and apply to both attacks. These are both opposed by your target, who can only counter-attack if both your attacks fail.</p>
        <h3>Damage</h3>
        <p>Most damage comes in multiples of D6. Unarmed attacks deal 2 damage. Some magic weapons may give a flat bonus, such as a +1 sword.</p>
        <h3>Armor</h3>
        <p>Armor reduces incoming damage by the <strong>armor value(AV)</strong> of the piece of armor. The <strong>durability value(DV)</strong> is the total number of hits a piece of armor can take before it breaks.</p>
      </div>
      
      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Progression</button>
      <div class="content">
        <h3>XP</h3>
        <p>Experience Points(XP) are a measure of progression. When earned, they are divided equally among all members of the party. There are a few ways to gain XP:
          <br>- 1XP per heart of vanquished enemies
          <br>- 1XP per coin earned(10 talons = 1 coin)
          <br>- 100XP per completed quest</p>
        <h3>Progression</h3>
        <p>Adventurers begin at level 1 and may choose from one of the classes on this page. They only start with abilities and items mentioned in the class description.
          <br>- Level 1: 0XP
          <br>- Level 2: 100XP
