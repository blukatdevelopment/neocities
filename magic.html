        This page is about magic. In case it is never expanded, I'll throw a few conclusions I've reached from my time looking into magic.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusions I've reached</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Religious practice can be divided into exoteric(external) and esoteric(internal) categories, with exoteric providing tools for groups and esoteric providing tools for individuals. Most religions have a mix of both, with the language of "religious" reflecting exoteric, and "spiritual" reflecting esoteric.</li>
        <li>Spirituality needn't involve the supernatural. The experience of holding a loved one's hand, gazing on a beautiful mountain, or laboring over a creative project are all examples of spirituality.</li>
        <li>Magic in general can be divided into high and low magic. Low magic seeks to alter the physical world via supernatural forces. High magic, however, aims to work on the psychology of the individual(often describing the psychology in supernatural terms).</li>
        <li>Low magic does not seem exist in any verifiable capacity, and so I discard the notion of low magic practice.</li>
        <li>High magic as psychology seems to some degree verifiable, with notable examples including Yoga, the placebo effect, and meditation having noticeable effects on the mind. Through influencing one's mind, high magic may influence their body(al psychosomatic effects) and actions. By changing one's actions, high magic may indirectly alter the physical world. One example is someone overcoming their fear of public speaking through their practice, and using their public speaking to run a fundraiser. In this way, high magic may do the work of low magic without invoking the supernatural.</li>
      </ul>
