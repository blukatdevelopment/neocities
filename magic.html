        This page is about magic. In case it is never expanded, I'll throw a few conclusions I've reached from my time looking into magic.
      </p>
      <h2>Religion: Exoteric VS Esoteric</h2>
      <p>
        You may have heard a Christian say "I'm not religious, but I am spiritual." to mean that they don't attend church, but that their faith is deeply personal. I'm going to throw more syllables into the mix and refer to exoteric religion and esoteric religion. I'm also going to say that there's generally a mixture of exoteric and esoteric expression within religion. A Christian might perform their religion in an exoteric fashion by attending church, adhering to the versions of Christian mythology and ethics the church approves of, and participating in events such as a bible study, soup kitchen, youth group, or fund raiser.
